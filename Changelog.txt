Attendance Report Manager v3

2-14-2015
Version 3 has been redone from the ground up due to v2 not functional, incomplete, and not having the best program design.
Only the core concepts exist from v2. 
Improvements:
	Functional instructor course manager and a crude attendance report.
	Everything persistes to the mysql database smoothly.
	
TODO:
	Add more data validation to both student and instructor side
	Add print feature to the instructor's attendance report
